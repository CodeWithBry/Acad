# Acad Web Application
This is an advanced To-do List web application that uses react JS as front-end and Firebase JS for the backend database, authentication and real-time database.

The version of this To-do List has its own editor where tasks can be edit whether you want to change its background-color, and border-color, font-color, font-weight, content, styles and many more.

You can upload files in each task that you want to upload to.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
